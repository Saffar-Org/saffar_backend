## What is Saffar?
A Test Taxi booking application. 

Saffar is an open source project to showcase the use of Flutter (Saffar app repository link [here](https://github.com/Saffar-Org/saffar_app/tree/dev)) with a Node JS backend along with TomTom maps service (Google Maps alternative. Link [here](https://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/)).

The backend uses Node JS (code in TypeScript) along with MongoDB as database, Redis for caching and TomTom as map service (Google maps alternative, link [here](https://www.tomtom.com/products/maps/)). The Node server is hosted in AWS.

## Folder structure
* **controller**: Contains all the controllers
* **middlewares** Contains all the middlewares
* **models**: Contains all the models
* **routes**: Contains all the routes
* **utils**: Contains the code for helpers and validators 
   
## AWS Hosting
The Node Server is hosted in AWS. For Node JS applications written in TypeScript, you have to first convert the TypeScript to JavaScript then deploy the code in AWS. I will be writing a tutorial on how to upload and deploy Node JS applications written in TypeScript in AWS Elastic Beanstalk so stay tuned.
